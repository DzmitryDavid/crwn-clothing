### 🎯 About

During [this](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-react-developer-redux-hooks-graphql-zero-to-mastery) course I've started from the very beginning by learning the basics of React and then deepened into advanced topics with the purpose of making good decisions on architecture and tools on any of my future ReactJS projects.

This project-based course introduced me to all of the modern toolchains of a React developer in 2021.
